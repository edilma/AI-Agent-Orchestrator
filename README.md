# Blog Agent Framework
📖 También disponible en [Español](README.es.md)

An advanced framework for building AI-powered content generation pipelines. This project uses a multi-agent system, powered by Microsoft Autogen, to autonomously write, critique, and review articles for quality, compliance, and SEO.
**Create smarter, better blogs—autonomously.**

The **Blog Agent Framework** is a plug-and-play Python library that helps you generate high-quality blog posts using a team of AI agents. Built on top of Microsoft’s powerful [Autogen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen) system, this framework mimics a professional content team: a writer, a critic, and multiple expert reviewers work together to craft concise, SEO-optimized, story-driven articles, designed to engage readers and rank well in search engines.  Applies best practices in digital marketing to improve the reach, structure, and impact of each post. 

Whether you're a solo blogger, content marketer, or developer, you can use this library to automate content creation or integrate it into your own API.

    ```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/edilma/AI-Agent-Orchestrator.git
    ```

## ✍️ Basic Usage
Here's how to quickly get started with the built-in example.

### Running the Example

1.  Navigate into the examples directory:
    ```bash
    cd examples
    ```

2.  Create your own .env file by copying the template. 
    ```bash
    # On Windows
    copy .env.example .env

    # On macOS or Linux
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

3.  Add your OpenAi credentials to the new .env file
    ```bash
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
    OPENAI_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
    ```

4.  Run the example script:
    ```bash
    python run_example.py
    ```
## 🧠 How It Works

The Blog Agent Framework simulates a collaborative writing and editing process using a team of specialized AI agents. Each agent plays a unique role in refining the blog post.

1. **Writer Agent**  
   Creates an initial blog post based on a topic prompt. The post is designed to be simple, engaging, and story-driven.

2. **Critic Agent**  
   Reviews the writer's draft and offers direct, actionable feedback. This agent evaluates story structure, clarity, tone, and flow—and helps polish the final version by incorporating all key reviewer suggestions.

3. **SEO Reviewer**  
   Ensures the blog includes relevant keywords, strong headings, and other on-page SEO elements to improve visibility on AI and search engines like Google and attracts organic traffic.

4. **Content Marketing Reviewer**  
   Analyzes structure, engagement, and presentation. Helps make sure the blog is clear, logically organized, and engaging for readers.

5. **Clarity and Ethics Reviewer**  
   Checks that the writing is easy to understand for a general audience, free of confusing or problematic language, and appropriate for public consumption.

The agents communicate intelligently to revise and refine the blog post until it meets quality standards for readability, SEO, and flow.
